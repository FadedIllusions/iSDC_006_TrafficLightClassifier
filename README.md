# iSDC_006_TrafficLightClassifier

Project 006 of Udacity's "Intro To Self-Driving Cars", Implement A Traffic Light Classifier using computer vision, without use of a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) or any other Deep Learning Approach.

Our project had to adhere to the following:
  * All Images Scaled/Cropped To Same Size
  * All Labels Encoded With One-Hot Encoder
  * Features Extracted From HSV Colorspace
  * Not Any Red Light Can Be Misclassified
  * Model Must Acheive 90%, Or Greater, Accuracy

I was able to acheive a 92.59% Accuracy with my model.
